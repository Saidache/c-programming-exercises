## 1. Basics of C Programming

This section covers fundamental concepts like input/output, variables, operators, and basic data types.

*   Write a program to print "Hello, World!".
*   Write a program to take two integers as input and print their sum.
*   Write a program to find the area of a rectangle using its length and breadth.
*   Write a program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable.
*   Write a program to check if a given number is even or odd.

## 2. Control Statements

This section focuses on conditional statements (if-else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while) for controlling program flow.

*   Write a program to find the largest of three numbers using if-else.
*   Write a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
*   Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop.
*   Write a program to print the first n natural numbers using a while loop.
*   Write a program to display the multiplication table of a given number.

## 3. Arrays

This section introduces arrays for storing collections of data of the same type.

*   Write a program to store 5 integers in an array and print them.
*   Write a program to find the largest and smallest elements in an array.
*   Write a program to calculate the sum and average of elements in an array.
*   Write a program to reverse an array.
*   Write a program to merge two arrays into a single array.

## 4. Strings

This section deals with character arrays and string manipulation.

*   Write a program to take a string as input and display its length.
*   Write a program to concatenate two strings without using library functions.
*   Write a program to check if a string is a palindrome.
*   Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
*   Write a program to find the frequency of a character in a string.
